#### How to Solve Problem

- Understand Problem
- Explore Examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Refactor/Optimize

#### Patterns

- **Frequency Counter**: This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings.

- **Multiple Pointers**: Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

- **Sliding Window**: This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created). Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

- **Divide and Conquer**: This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.

- **Dynamic Programming**, **Greedy Algorithms**, **Greedy Algorithms**, **Backtracking**, etc...
