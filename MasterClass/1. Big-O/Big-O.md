# Big-O Notation

Following are some key points about the Big-O Notation:
- An analysis about the performance of the algorithm.
- Depicts how the run time of an algorithm grows with input.
- A vocabulary to talk about how a code performs.
- A high level understanding of the time and space complexities of an algorithm.
- Trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches.
- Identify parts of the code that are inefficient.
